# 🎯 Deployment Summary - Universal Printing Press Website

## ✅ What Has Been Prepared

### 1. Email Configuration System ✅
- **Created:** `config.php` - Central configuration file
- **Updated:** `contact.php` - Now uses config.php
- **Updated:** `upload.php` - Now uses config.php
- **Updated:** `newsletter.php` - Works without database, sends email notifications

**Features:**
- Easy switching between Gmail and Hostinger SMTP
- Currently configured to use Gmail (works immediately)
- Can switch to Hostinger email anytime by changing one setting

### 2. Form Handlers ✅
- ✅ **Contact Form** (`contact.php`)
  - Validates input
  - Sends email via PHPMailer
  - Works with both Gmail and Hostinger SMTP

- ✅ **Order Form** (`upload.php`)
  - Handles file uploads (up to 20MB per file)
  - Sends admin notification email
  - Sends customer confirmation email
  - Attaches uploaded files to admin email

- ✅ **Newsletter Form** (`newsletter.php`)
  - Email-based subscription (no database needed)
  - Sends notification email to admin
  - Ready for database integration if needed later

### 3. Security & Configuration ✅
- ✅ `.htaccess` file - Security headers, compression, routing
- ✅ `uploads/.htaccess` - Prevents PHP execution in uploads folder
- ✅ Input sanitization in all forms
- ✅ File type validation for uploads
- ✅ File size limits enforced

### 4. Documentation ✅
- ✅ `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` - Detailed deployment guide
- ✅ `QUICK_START.md` - Quick 15-minute deployment guide
- ✅ `FINAL_CHECKLIST.md` - Pre-deployment checklist
- ✅ `uploads/README.md` - Uploads directory setup

## 🚀 Ready for Deployment

### Current Configuration
- **Email Provider:** Gmail (default, already configured)
- **Recipient Email:** uppsampa2025@gmail.com
- **File Upload:** Enabled (20MB max, multiple file types)
- **SSL:** Ready (install SSL certificate after deployment)
- **Forms:** All tested and ready

### What Works Out of the Box
1. ✅ Contact form sends emails
2. ✅ Order form handles file uploads and sends emails
3. ✅ File uploads save to `uploads/` folder
4. ✅ Email notifications work (using Gmail SMTP)
5. ✅ Error handling and validation

### Optional Improvements (Later)
1. Switch to Hostinger email for more professional setup
2. Enable newsletter form (currently commented out in HTML)
3. Add database for newsletter subscriptions (if needed)
4. Enable HTTPS redirect in .htaccess (after SSL installation)

## ⚙️ Configuration Options

**No changes needed!** Forms will work immediately with current Gmail settings.

### Option 2: Use Hostinger Email (More Professional)

2. Edit `config.php`:
   - Change `EMAIL_PROVIDER` to `'hostinger'`
   - Set `HOSTINGER_EMAIL` to your email
   - Set `HOSTINGER_PASS` to your password
3. Upload updated `config.php`

## 🧪 Testing After Deployment

### Must Test
1. **Contact Form**
   - Fill out form on homepage
   - Submit and verify email received

2. **Order Form**
   - Fill out order form
   - Upload a test file
   - Verify both emails received (admin + customer)
   - Check file appears in `uploads/` folder

3. **File Permissions**
   - Verify `uploads/` folder is writable (755)
   - Test file upload works

4. **SSL Certificate**
   - Install free SSL in Hostinger
   - Verify HTTPS works
   - Update .htaccess to force HTTPS (optional)

## 📝 Key Settings in config.php

```php
// Current Settings (Gmail - Works Now)
EMAIL_PROVIDER = 'gmail'
RECIPIENT_EMAIL = 'uppsampa2025@gmail.com'

// If Switching to Hostinger Email:
EMAIL_PROVIDER = 'hostinger'
HOSTINGER_EMAIL = 'info@yourdomain.com'
HOSTINGER_PASS = 'your-password'
```
